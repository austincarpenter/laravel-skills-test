# Laravel Skills Exercise
1. How long did you spend to complete this test?  
I would estimate about 3-4 hours. This was due to a few reasons: I managed to do all of the bonus exercises, which of course lengthened the time it took to complete the test; and the fact that I ran into some troubles with absolute/relative paths in my development environment and saving images through the Intervention Image library versus the Storage facade.

2. What was easy?  
Most things required to complete the task were easy: setting up the database with migrations, modifying the seeder, modifying the HomeController to be able to save a new Post to the database, adding validation, and adjusting the home.blade.php file to show all a user's posts and show Delete buttons for each (I added this last functionality).

3. What was hard?  
Nothing was hard, rather, the other things I haven't mentioned (such as writing tests, which I haven't really done too much before with Laravel, resizing images, etc.) just took time to work through, as I had to reference the relevant documentation and try out different approaches to get the desired result. Setting up a local Laravel environment on macOS Big Sur (which also required me to set up MAMP, etc.) took a little bit of time to tweak to get right. I would look into Valet in the future or running through a cloud IDE (which is what we had during the Uni course) – always open to new things!
